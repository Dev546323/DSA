skipping kadane's for the time being, seems to confusing. 

for moore- since the target appears more than size/2 times, the frequency will always be ++ for the target. 
let's say 1 is target number appearing more then size/2 times and 2 appears for the rest of the array
2 can't appear more times than 1 hence, answer will always be 1. 

check water.cpp for 2 pointer approach. 
basically checking both sides of the vector at the same time. 

power.cpp uses binary operations to take out the power effeciently, 

selfpdt.cpp is to take out the product of array except self
